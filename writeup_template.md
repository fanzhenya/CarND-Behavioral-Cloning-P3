**Behavioral Cloning Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Rubric Points
### Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/432/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Files Submitted & Code Quality

#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode

My project includes the following files:
* train.ipynb (or model.py) containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network 
* writeup_report.md or writeup_report.pdf summarizing the results

#### 2. Submission includes functional code
Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing 
```sh
python drive.py weights/model-01-0.00448764.h5
```

#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable

The train.ipynb (or model.py) file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

My model consists of a convolution neural network with 5x5 or 3x3 filter sizes and depths between 12 and 48 

The model includes RELU layers to introduce nonlinearity, and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer.


#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

The model contains Batch Normalization and Dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting. 

The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (skleran `tran_test_split`). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.

#### 3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually.

#### 4. Appropriate training data

Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, reverse loop driving and recovering from the left and right sides of the road. I didn't use multi camera because I doubt its validity.

For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. 

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Solution Design Approach

The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to regress the steering angle based on images generated by a monocular camera mounted on a car.

My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the [Nvidia paper](http://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf).

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. 

To combat the overfitting, I modified the model by adding Batch Normalization and Dropout so that training set loss is constantly highter than validation set.


The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track. To improve the driving behavior in these cases, I collected more data, especially multiple possible positions with in the lane, and scens where I try to recover from over shotting the turns.

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

#### 2. Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes.

Here is a visualization of the architecture.

#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:

I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to recover from these positions. These images show what a recovery looks like starting from a sharp turn :

To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles thinking that this would double the dataset. I do this inside of a Keras Sequence object so that I generate random flipped images on the fly.

After the collection process, I had about 34K number of data points. I then preprocessed these images by doing a perspective transform. It works very well. It's also explainable: it enables the network to learn more from far away curbs that otherwise would be too small to be picked up by the convolution filters. Note I also need to transform the images in drive.py.

I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 20% of the data into a validation set. 

I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs is around 5 as evidenced by validation loss greater than training loss in training curve. I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.
